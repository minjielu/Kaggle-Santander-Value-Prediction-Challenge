  1. Folder 'Main solutions' contains notebooks used to generate the final result
    a. 'Final_model_lightGBM+XGBoost.ipynb' contains major procedures of developing the machine learning model resulting in a mean
       squared root log error of 1.38.
    b. The competition is kind of ruined after a leak is found. But skills can still be learnt from the procedure of searching for
       the Toeplitz matrix like leak. 'Search_for_leaks.ipynb' includes my own effort of searching for new leak groups.
       
  2. Folder 'Other attempts' includes all attempts that are not very helpful during my exploration. It also includes some files for
     data observation and preprocessing.
